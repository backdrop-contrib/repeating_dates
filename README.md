# Repeating Dates

Ships with a custom field type for recurring (repeating) dates based on ICAL
rules.

New module, probably not working yet, but testing is welcome.
OK, maybe it works, but no guarantee... ;-)

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS
 [instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules)

## Credits

To calculate the list of dates, this module uses the MIT licensed
 [RRULE for PHP](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-rrule) library by RÃ©mi Lanvin
([rlanvin](https://github.com/rlanvin))

This module is inspired by, but in no way similar to Date Repeat, which is
currently getting forked - but that turned out to be way more difficult,
because it's an incomplete stub.
